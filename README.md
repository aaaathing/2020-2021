Things I made from 2020 to 2021. don't delete!

The index.json files contain the timestamps of when they were made. Some timestamps were messed up when copying the files from old computer.

html stuff: things i made on chromebook. July 2020 - March 2021
desktop: things i made on windows computer

I don't want to worry about these getting deleted anymore. what a mess, not all the files are here.
